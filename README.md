# monopolyExplore
An exploration of moving around the Monopoly board, NOT a working Monopoly game.

The program models the Monopoly game, using standard movement rules. It is NOT a playable version of the game. Instead, 
it moves many thousands of times, recording where each move landed. At the end, very basic statistics are printed.

The game runs from the command line as Monopoly.exe.
